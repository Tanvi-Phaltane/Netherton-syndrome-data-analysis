# Netherton-syndrome-data-analysis
I came across Netherton syndrome term while reading news. I had no idea what it was so decided to adopt a 'text mining' approach to understand more about it. Therefore, I looked at PubMed database from NCBI resource to understand learn about it. 
The questions I tried to answer are :
1) What does the literature talk about?
2) Since when is the syndrome being studied??
3) Which are the countries actively working in this field?

Spink5-/- mice recapitulate NS and die perinatally from extensive dehydration as a result of a severe defect of the epidermal barrier. We showed that deletion of Klk5 in Spink5-/- rescues neonatal lethality (Furio et al., 2015). However, Spink5-/-Klk5-/- mice developed skin shedding and inflammation during the first week from birth and the majority (70%) succumbed on P7. The remaining mice lived short (i.e. mean survival was 5\u202fmonths) indicating alternative inflammatory pathways. Since cathelicidin is increased in Spink5-/- epidermis, we investigated whether it could be implicated in NS pathology. Ablation of Camp in Spink5-/- suppressed epidermal inflammation and restored abnormal epidermal differentiation, nevertheless, it failed to inhibit overdesquamation and Spink5-/-Camp-/- succumbed perinatally due to skin barrier defect, similarly to Spink5-/-. Joint invalidation of Klk5 and Camp significantly extended survival of Spink5-/-Klk5-/-Camp-/- mice. We provide evidence that cathelicidin is implicated in NS-associated skin inflammation in vivo. Therefore, marketed products that are known to reduce cathelicidin expression could be repurposed for the management of NS.", "keywords": ["Cathelicidin", "Epidermal inflammation", "KLK5", "Klk5", "Mouse models", "Netherton syndrome", "SPINK5"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165831"}

We compared in situ expression levels and activities of GBA and ASM between NTS patients and controls and correlated the expression and activities with i) stratum corneum ceramide profiles, ii) in situ serine protease activity, and iii) clinical presentation of patients. Using activity-based probe labeling, we visualized and localized active, epidermal GBA, and a newly developed in situ zymography method enabled us to visualize and localize active ASM. Reduction in active GBA in NTS patients coincided with increased ASM activity, particularly in areas with increased serine protease activity. NTS patients with scaly erythroderma exhibited more pronounced anomalies in GBA and ASM activities than patients with ichthyosis linearis circumflexa. They also displayed a stronger increase in stratum corneum ceramides processed via ASM.

Although the function of KLK5 and KLK7 has been previously studied, the role of KLK14 in skin homeostasis and its contribution to Netherton syndrome pathogenesis remains unknown. We generated a transgenic murine model overexpressing human KLK14 (TghKLK14) in stratum granulosum. TghKLK14 mice revealed increased proteolytic activity in the granular layers and in hair follicles. Their hair did not grow and displayed major defects with hyperplastic hair follicles when hKLK14 was overexpressed. TghKLK14 mice displayed abnormal epidermal hyperproliferation and differentiation. Ultrastructural analysis revealed cell separation in the hair cortex and increased thickness of Huxley's layer. Desmoglein (Dsg) 2 staining was increased, whereas Dsg3 and Dsg4 were markedly reduced. In\u00a0vitro studies showed that hKLK14 directly cleaves recombinant human DSG3 and recombinant human DSG4, suggesting that their degradation contributes to hair abnormalities.

A 15-year-old male with NS was referred with suspicion of acute leukemia. Severe anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated CRP level were demonstrated in pre-hospital laboratory tests. Physical examination revealed generalized ichthyosiform erythroderma. ALL was diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow biopsy. The patient was initially classified as CNS3 status. No signals indicating fusion of BCR/ABL1, ETV6, and RUNX1 genes and MLL gene rearrangement were found in the cytogenetic analysis. The patient was qualified for chemotherapy and treated according to ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocol for high-risk ALL. During induction therapy, severe skin toxicity occurred (WHO grade III), which prompted the modification of treatment down to intermediate-risk strategy. In the course of reinduction therapy, severe chemotherapy-induced adverse drug reactions occurred, including progression of skin toxicity to WHO grade IV. The patient achieved complete remission. In view of life-threatening toxicities and the confirmed complete remission, intensive chemotherapy regimen was discontinued and maintenance treatment was started. Because of the baseline CNS3 status, the patient received cranial radiotherapy. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify disease-associated mutations. WES revealed two germline mutations: a novel premature termination variant in SPINK5 (p.Cys510*), along with a novel potentially pathogenic variant in NUP214 (p.Arg815Gln). Somatic mutations were known pathogenic variants of JAK2 (p.Arg683Gly), IL17RC (p.Ala303Thr), and potentially pathogenic non-synonymous variants of TTN (p.Gly1091Arg and p.Pro17245Leu), ACTN2 (p.Ile143Leu), TRPV3 (p.Arg729*), and COL7A1 (p.Glu2842fs) genes. Currently, the patient continues maintenance chemotherapy, with stable status of skin lesions and no features of ALL relapse. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ALL in a patient with NS. As has been presented, in such patients, optimal treatment according to the current protocols is extremely difficult. WES was used to confirm the diagnosis of Ph-like ALL in our patient. The detection of JAK2 gene mutation offers the possibility of therapy personalization. A specific signature of rare germline variants and somatic mutations can be proposed as a factor predisposing to the co-incidence of ALL and NS.", "keywords": ["Netherton syndrome", "children", "leukemia", "malignancy", "mutation"], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.3389/fonc.2019.01477"}

Netherton syndrome previously misdiagnosed as hyper IgE syndrome caused by a probable mutation in SPINK5 C. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 604-607. Netherton syndrome (NS, MIM256500) is an autosomal recessive disorder that includes ichthyosis linearis circumflexa and a predisposition to allergies, asthma, and eczema, with hypereosinophilia, trichorrhexis invaginata, and elevated serum IgE levels. The genetic bases of Netherton syndrome are mutations in the gene SPINK5, and the Lymphoepitheial Kazal type related inhibitor, a serine protease inhibitor, is encoded by SPINK. Here a case is presented which showed a probable splice site mutation in SPINK5, which was previously unknown in databases and the literature, to point out the misdiagnosis of Hyper IgE Syndrome in the early presentation of the phenotype. This case highlights that a genetic test can be critical for identifying NS. The finding of underlying mutations contributes to the understanding of Netherton syndrome and is instrumental in indicating a specific therapy. Notably, treatment with acitretin has significantly improved both the ichthyosis linearis circumflexa and eczema in our patient.", "keywords": ["Netherton syndrome", "eczema", "hyper IgE syndrome", "ichthyosis", "serum IgE"], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.24953/turkjped.2019.04.020"}

Since patients with NS suffer from recurrent infections, it has been hypothesized that an underlying immunodeficiency attributes to this. Here, we studied clinical and immunological characteristics of the cohort of NS patients in the Netherlands in order to identify whether potential immunodeficiencies result in the increased risk of infectious complications. Phenotypes were scored for severity of skin condition, specific hair shaft defects, atopy, and recurrent infections. Patients' blood samples were collected for quantification of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, specific antibodies against Streptococcus pneumoniae, and allergen-specific IgE, as well as detailed immunophenotyping of blood leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry. A total of 14 patients were included with age range 3-46\u00a0years and varying degrees of skin involvement. All patients presented with atopic symptoms (food allergy, n\u00a0=\u00a013; hay fever, n\u00a0=\u00a010; asthma, n\u00a0=\u00a07). Recurrent skin infections were common, particularly in childhood (n\u00a0=\u00a012). Low levels of specific antibodies against S\u00a0pneumoniae were found in 10 of 11 evaluated patients. Detailed immunological analysis was performed on 9 adult patients. Absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets and serum immunoglobulin levels were all within normal ranges. Multidisciplinary evaluation of our national cohort showed no evidence for a severe, clinically relevant systemic immunodeficiency. Therefore, we conclude that in Dutch NS patients the increased risk of infections most likely results from the skin barrier disruption and that increased allergen penetration predisposes to allergic sensitization.", "keywords": ["Comel-Netherton syndrome", "SPINK5", "allergy", "dermatitis", "immunodeficiency"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1111/all.14197"}

Moderate to excellent response (PGA decrease of \u22651 point) was observed in 7 (78%) of the nine patients with CHE, one of the two patients with extensive AD and in the one patient with ARCI. In the remaining four subjects, no convincing effect was documented. Tolerability was overall very good. The most common adverse event was headache in 10 patients (77%) during the initiation of treatment, leading to interruption of therapy in one subject.

Consumption was estimated at 7.2kg per year. On examination, she had osteoporosis, Cushing's syndrome, corticotropic insufficiency and inframammary, axillary, and intergluteal superinfected intertrigo. During hospitalization for necrotic leg wounds on severe skin atrophy, she sustained a fracture on falling down. The course was marked by the onset of septic shock of unknown etiology, complicated by acute adrenal insufficiency leading to fatal multi-organ failure. Many iatrogenic cases related to topical corticosteroids in children have been reported in the literature, including one case of fatal outcome (CMV infection) in an infant. Such iatrogenic cases are rarer in adults and we observed no fatal cases. In NS, the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are amplified due to the major defect in the skin barrier which enhances the systemic passage of these drugs. In the absence of any effective therapeutic alternative, weaning patients off topical corticosteroids is usually difficult. This case illustrates the severity of iatrogenic effects secondary to misuse of topical corticosteroids in NS as well as the need to find effective new treatments for this syndrome.", "keywords": ["Adrenal insufficiency", "Cushing syndrome", "Dermocortico\u00efdes", "Insuffisance surr\u00e9nalienne", "Netherton syndrome", "Osteoporosis", "Ost\u00e9oporose", "Syndrome de Cushing", "Syndrome de Netherton", "Topical steroids"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.annder.2019.09.003"}

Hair changes may be a significant finding or even the initial presentation of a syndrome giving a clue to the diagnosis, such as Netherton syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. Detailed history including family history and physical examination of hair and other ectodermal structures such as nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands with the use of dermoscopic devices and biopsy all provide important clues to establish the correct diagnosis. Understanding the pathophysiology of genetic hair defects will allow for better comprehension of their treatment and prognosis.

KLKs comprise 15 serine proteases, and their activities are regulated by complex and fine-tuned mechanisms involving the proteolytic activation cascade, endogenous inhibitors, and environmental factors. When the balance is disrupted, excessive or insufficient protease activity can impair epidermal barrier homeostasis. KLKs are involved in various events, such as skin inflammation, wound healing, pruritus, anti-bacterial activity, and viral susceptibility. One of the primary roles of KLKs, mainly KLK5 and KLK7, is physiological desquamation. Both proteases are also involved in the development of inflammatory skin diseases with barrier abnormalities, e.g., Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis (AD). In Netherton syndrome, unrestricted activity of KLK5 due to loss of the major endogenous inhibitor, lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI), destroys the component molecules of corneodesmosome, leading to Th2 and Th17 inflammation. Meanwhile, the increased activity of KLK7 in the hyperkeratotic lesions of chronic AD is suppressed by upregulated LEKTI. The functions and implications of other KLKs including KLK6 and KLK8 in healthy and diseased skin such as psoriasis represent an exciting but relatively unexplored area. Clarifying the function of epidermal KLKs will enable development of disease-specific biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies.", "keywords": ["Atopic dermatitis", "Corneodesmosome", "Desquamation", "Epidermal barrier function", "KLK5", "KLK6", "KLK7", "KLK8", "Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs)", "LEKTI", "Netherton syndrome", "Protease-activated receptor (PAR)", "Psoriasis"], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.1016/j.jdermsci.2019.06.007"}

NS symptoms are recapitulated in Spink5-/- mouse where the gene encoding Lekti has been invalidated. Spink5-/- mice die within 5h from birth due to their severe skin barrier defect leading to dehydration. Spink5-/- mice also serve as a model for atopic dermatitis. The KLK6 protease is expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and shown in vitro to cleave desmosomal components. To investigate in vivo whether KLK6 is implicated in epidermal overdesquamation and/or inflammation associated with NS. The role of KLK6 was evaluated by generating Spink5-/-Klk6-/- double knockout mice. The phenotype was assessed by macroscopic observation, immunohistochemistry for differentiation markers, in situ zymography for proteolysis, and quantification of proinflammatory cytokines. Elimination of Klk6 in Spink5-/- remarkably suppresses the expression of Tslp, a major itching-inducing factor and driver of allergic reactions. Tnf\u03b1 and the Th17 promoting cytokine Il-23 were also suppressed. Spink5-/-Klk6-/- mice display normalized keratinocyte differentiation, nevertheless, epidermal proteolytic activities and the associated overdesquamation were not ameliorated, and Spink5-/-Klk6-/- still died from a severe epidermal barrier defect as the Spink5-/-. Ablation of Klk6 largely suppresses epidermal inflammation but cannot rescue overdesquamation leading to the lethal NS phenotype.

Ninety-four ichthyosis patients from four different centres were recruited to participate in this cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study. All participants completed the Leuven Itch Scale, a multidimensional self-report instrument that quantifies the frequency, duration, severity, distress, consequences and surface area of itch.

Itch occurred in 93% of all patients. In patients with itch, 63% reported that it was often or always present, although most itch episodes were short in duration. Itch, in all its dimensions, was worst in patients with Netherton syndrome. Patients with XLRI had in general a lower itch profile. About half of all ichthyosis patients reported to experience flares during a change in weather, in a hot environment or in stressful situations, whereas a cold environment led to itch in only 26% of patients. The most significant consequences of itching were lesions from scratching, difficulties in falling asleep, bad mood and loss of concentration.

Here, we describe the case of a female infant with severe immune dysregulation leading to recurrent systemic infections, failure to thrive and severe crises of ichthyosiform erythroderma with high levels of serum IgE. Hence, initial symptoms indicated Netherton syndrome or Omenn syndrome. Surprisingly, sequence analyses of SPINK5 and RAG1/RAG2, respectively, excluded these diseases. During the hospital stay the patient's health deteriorated, despite intensive care therapy, and she died. In order to delineate the diagnosis, whole-exome sequencing was performed. Two compound heterozygous mutations in MALT1 were found and verified by Sanger sequencing (exon 2 c.245T>C, exon 2 c.310dup), which led to a MALT1 deficiency at the protein level. Based on these results, an immunological analysis was performed, as was immunofluorescence staining of key skin proteins, to confirm a diagnosis of MALT1 deficiency. This case report provides a closer description of the clinical and histological skin phenotype of MALT1 deficiency, and we conclude that MALT1 deficiency must be considered a possible differential diagnosis of Netherton and Omenn syndromes. What's already known about this topic? Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) deficiency is a combined immunodeficiency. MALT1 is part of the caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11-B-cell lymphoma 10-MALT1 signalosome complex, which is essential for nuclear factor kappa B activation. Current publications describe a phenotype of recurrent systemic infections; only in a few cases has an inflammatory involvement of the integument been described. What does this study add? A closer description of the cutaneous phenotype of MALT1 deficiency in a patient with two novel MALT1 mutations. Immune mapping of follicular epidermis shows lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor is reduced in MALT1 deficiency and absent on interfollicular staining. Clinically, MALT1 deficiency mimics Netherton syndrome and Omenn syndrome, and should be considered a differential diagnosis.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1111/bjd.18091"}

Patients with Netherton syndrome (LEKTI deficiency) have increased activity of both TG1 and serin proteases. To determine whether there is a functional biochemical link between TG1 and LEKTI and whether LEKTI domains could possibly serve as substrates for TG1. We analysed the protein sequence of LEKTI for possible TG1 recognition sites using bioinformatics. Synthetic peptides and recombinant LEKTI domains D6, D7 and D8+9 were examined in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0situ for possible substrate specificity. The recombinant LEKTI domains were studied for inhibitory activity in a kallikrein (KLK)5 activity test. We identified possible TG1 consensus sequences in LEKTI domains D6, D7 and D8+9, pointing to a novel biological link between these two proteins. Indeed, synthesized short peptides from these consensus sequences were incorporated into the TG1 activity zone of the epidermis. In vitro the entire recombinant domains of LEKTI showed substrate specificity for TG1, which was again confirmed in\u00a0situ. The inhibitory activity of the recombinant LEKTI domains was confirmed by a KLK5 inhibition test. The strongest inhibition was observed for domains D8+9. There are specific domains of LEKTI that are recognized and processed by TG1. LEKTI domains D6, D7 and D8+9 contribute to the formation and protection of the cornified envelope. These results impact the development of protein replacement therapy approaches for Netherton syndrome. What's already known about this topic? LEKTI and transglutaminase (TG)1 are key proteins involved in the terminal differentiation of the epidermis. Lack of LEKTI causes Netherton syndrome; TG1 deficiency causes lamellar ichthyosis. The serine protease inhibitor LEKTI is processed into different functional units. Among different target proteases, kallikrein (KLK)5 appears to be a key player in disease pathology. It has been demonstrated that LEKTI domain 6 inhibits KLK5 and KLK7; LEKTI domains 8-11 also inhibit KLK14. What does this study add? The single LEKTI domains 6, 7 and the functional unit of domains 8 and 9 contain recognition motifs for TG1. We show that these domains and unit are crosslinked into the epidermis by TG1. Functional analyses of the recombinant LEKTI domains revealed that LEKTI D8+9 has the strongest inhibitory effect on KLK5. What is the translational message? The novel functional link between LEKTI and TG1 should be taken into account when considering the development of a targeted topical protein therapy for Netherton syndrome. The unit of domains D8+9 may be sufficient for this purpose.", "keywords": [], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.1111/bjd.17820"}

LEKTI is known to be an essential molecule for the epidermal skin barrier, as demonstrated by SPINK5 nonsense mutation, which results in Netherton syndrome. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns or damage-associated molecular patterns and produce inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides. However, the effect of TLR signaling on the expression of LEKTI is not clear. To investigate whether TLR signaling can affect expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes. We stimulated a panel of TLR ligands and investigated the expression of LEKTI in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). We further measured trypsin or chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity in NHEK cultured media under stimulation with TLR3 ligand, poly (I:C). Immunostaining for LEKTI was performed using skin samples from skin infectious diseases. TLR1/2, 3, 5, and 2/6 ligands induced the expression of LEKTI in NHEKs. The trypsin or chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity in NHEKs was up-regulated with the stimulation of poly (I:C). The gene expressions of KLK6, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK13 were also increased by poly (I:C). An immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression of LEKTI was up-regulated in the lesions of varicella, pyoderma, and rosacea. TLR signaling induces the expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes, which might contribute to the control of aberrant serine protease activities in inflammatory skin diseases.", "keywords": ["Epidermal keratinocytes", "Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor", "Serine protease inhibitor", "Toll-like receptor"], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.1016/j.jdermsci.2018.09.001"}

Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome patients showed a significantly higher risk of skin infections than patients with other phenotypes. Complete data on DLQI were obtained from 13 patients, whose median age was 21 (8-71) years. Nine patients were male, and 4 were female. Systemic retinoids were administrated to 2 of the 3 HI patients. The Spearman's correlation coefficient between the clinical ichthyosis score and DLQI was 0.611 (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Update and familiarity with these clinical features will help to make a better diagnose, assessment and treatment of HIES. Although hyper serum IgE levels have been identified in PGM3 deficiency and Comel-Netherton syndrome, PGM3 and SPINK5 genes were not included in the list of genetic etiologies of AR-HIES by the Expert Committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies until 2015. The identification of these HIES-causing genes greatly promoted the pathogenic mechanism studies of HIES. Also, in recent years, more clinical manifestations, which were often not of concern in HIES patients, have been shown to be highly related to HIES. For example, a significantly high frequency of vascular and gastrointestinal abnormities has been reported in STAT3-deficient AD-HIES patients. These new findings might help to provide new clues to the functional study of these HIES-related genes.

Gene, protein, and serum studies were performed on skin and blood samples from 29 patients (congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, n\u00a0=\u00a09; lamellar ichthyosis, n\u00a0=\u00a08; epidermolytic ichthyosis, n\u00a0=\u00a08; and Netherton syndrome, n\u00a0=\u00a04), as well as age-matched healthy control subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a014), patients with psoriasis (n\u00a0=\u00a030), and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD; n\u00a0=\u00a016). Using criteria of a fold change of greater than 2 and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05, 132 differentially expressed genes were shared commonly among all ichthyoses, including many IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1-coregulated genes, which are considered hallmarks of psoriasis (defensin beta 4A, kynureninase, and vanin 3). Although striking upregulation of TH17 pathway genes (IL17F and IL36B/G) resembling that seen in patients with psoriasis was common to all patients with ichthyoses in a severity-related manner, patients with Netherton syndrome showed the greatest T-cell activation (inducible costimulator [ICOS]) and a broader immune phenotype with TH1/IFN-\u03b3, OASL, and TH2/IL-4 receptor/IL-5 skewing, although less than seen in patients with AD (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Ichthyoses lacked the epidermal differentiation and tight junction alterations of patients with AD (loricrin, filaggrin, and claudin 1) but showed characteristic alterations in lipid metabolism genes (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3 and galanin), with parallel reductions in extracellular lipids and corneocyte compaction in all ichthyoses except epidermolytic ichthyosis, suggesting phenotypic variations. Transepidermal water loss, a functional barrier measure, significantly correlated with IL-17-regulated gene expression (IL17F and IL36A/IL36B/IL36G). Similar to patients with AD and psoriasis, in whom cytokine dysregulation and barrier impairment orchestrate disease phenotypes, psoriasis-like immune dysregulation and lipid alterations characterize the ichthyoses.

Stimulation with the PAR2-activating peptide SLIGKV promoted Ca2+ store depletion in both undifferentiated human primary keratinocytes and DhPKs. SLIGKV-evoked Ca2+ store depletion did not trigger the store-operated Ca2+ entry (i.e., SOCE) through ORAI1 in DhPKs compared with undifferentiated human primary keratinocytes.

In Netherton syndrome, which is caused by an absence of the protease inhibitor lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor, premature degradation of corneodesmosomes occurs due to the overactivation of proteases involved in corneodesmosome degradation. Inflammatory peeling skin disease is caused by the absence of corneodesmosin, a unique component of corneodesmosomes. In this disease, corneodesmosomes are structurally abnormal, and their adhesiveness is compromised, which leads to intercellular splitting between the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum.

Despite underlying genetic origin, most of the health professionals solely rely on phenotypic expression of these disorders that leads to improper management of patients, hence making these patients living an orphanage life. After dermal features, association of other systems such as nervous system, skeletal system, hair abnormalities or liver problems may sometimes give clues for diagnosis but still leaving place for molecular screening for efficient diagnosis.

In this study, we further elucidated the in vivo roles of the epidermal proteases in NS using a set of mouse models individually or simultaneously deficient for KLK5 and KLK7 on the genetic background of a novel NS-mouse model. We show that although the ablation of KLK5 or KLK7 is not sufficient to rescue the lethal effect of LEKTI-deficiency simultaneous deficiency of both KLKs completely rescues the epidermal barrier and the postnatal lethality allowing mice to reach adulthood with fully functional skin and normal hair growth. We report that not only KLK5 but also KLK7 plays an important role in the inflammation and defective differentiation in NS and KLK7 activity is not solely dependent on activation by KLK5.

In the normal skin, their activities are controlled by an endogenous protein protease inhibitor encoded by the SPINK5 gene. Loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 leads to enhanced skin kallikrein activities and cause the skin disease Netherton Syndrome (NS). We have been developing inhibitors based on the Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1) scaffold, a 14 amino acids head-to-tail bicyclic peptide with a disulfide bond. To optimize a previously reported SFTI-1 analogue (I10H), we made five analogues with additional substitutions, two of which showed improved inhibition. We then combined those substitutions and discovered a variant (Analogue 6) that displayed dual inhibition of KLK5 (tryptic) and KLK7 (chymotryptic). Analogue 6 attained a tenfold increase in KLK5 inhibition potency with an Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Kd of 20nM. Furthermore, it selectively inhibits KLK5 and KLK14 over seven other serine proteases. Its biological function was ascertained by full suppression of KLK5-induced Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR-2) dependent intracellular calcium mobilization and postponement of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion in cell model. Moreover, Analogue 6 permeates through the cornified layer of in vitro organotypic skin equivalent culture and inhibits protease activities therein, providing a potential drug lead for the treatment of NS.", "keywords": [], "year": 2016, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0166268"}

Clinical measures included the Ichthyosis Area Severity Index (IASI), which integrates erythema (IASI-E) and scaling (IASI-S); transepidermal water loss; and pruritus. Ichthyosis samples showed increased epidermal hyperplasia (increased thickness and keratin 16 expression) and T-cell and dendritic cell infiltrates. Increases of general inflammatory (IL-2), innate (IL-1\u03b2), and some TH1/interferon (IFN-\u03b3) markers in patients with ichthyosis were comparable with those in patients with psoriasis or AD. TNF-\u03b1 levels in patients with ichthyosis were increased only in those with Netherton syndrome but were much lower than in patients with psoriasis and those with AD.

Netherton syndrome is characterized by neonatal scaling erythroderma, a bamboolike hair defect, a substantial skin barrier defect, and a profound atopic diathesis. Netherton syndrome has been proposed to be a primary immunodeficiency syndrome because of the high frequency of infections. The precise mechanisms underlying the disease are not fully understood. To study the association of the SPINK5 mutation with the NS phenotype and the extent of immunologic deficiencies in NS. Relevant tissue samples and follow-up data from 11 patients with NS from 7 families, including 3 multiplex families, were collected, constituting all known patients with NS in Finland. Another patient with NS from a neighboring country was included. Data were collected from August 10, 2011, to February 20, 2015. SPINK5 mutations were sequenced, and thorough clinical evaluation and histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluations of skin samples were performed. The function of natural killer cells, lymphocyte phenotype, and serum immunoglobulin subclass levels were evaluated. Data analysis was conducted from October 19, 2011, to February 20, 2015. The nature of SPINK5 mutations and their correlation with phenotypes in Finnish patients with NS, intrafamilial phenotype variations, and the type of immunologic defects in NS were evaluated. Among the 11 Finnish patients with NS (8 male [73%]; 3 female [27%]; mean [SD] age, 30.1 [9.1] years), a Finnish founder mutation c.652C>T (p.Arg218*) in SPINK5 was identified in 10 patients from 6 families who all originated from the same region. Eight patients were homozygotes for this mutation and 2 siblings were compound heterozygotes with a splice site mutation c.1220 + 1G>C (IVS13 + 1 G>C). Phenotypes were comparable, but some intrafamilial and interfamilial variations were noted. Compound heterozygous patients had a milder phenotype and showed residual LEKTI expression. A previously unreported c.1772delT (p.Leu591Glnfs124*) mutation was found in 1 patient with a phenotype similar to the patients homozygous for the founder mutation. The patient from the neighboring country had a distinct phenotype and different mutations. Immunologically, natural killer cells had an immature phenotype and impaired cytotoxicity and degranulation, levels of memory B cells were reduced, and serum IgG4 levels were elevated. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment has been beneficial in 1 patient with NS. This report discloses a prevalent SPINK5 founder mutation in Finland and illustrates NS phenotype variability. Our results also point to a possible role of immature immunity in the frequent infections seen in NS.", "keywords": [], "year": 2016, "doi": "10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.5827"}

The histological features of skin biopsies, usually described as a psoriasiform hyperplasia, have only been reported in isolated case reports or small case series. The aim of this study is to define, for the first time, the precise histological pattern of cutaneous lesions, in a large cohort of skin biopsies from confirmed NS patients. The study included 80 consecutive skin biopsies from 67 patients taken between January 1995 and June 2014. All were from confirmed NS patients with either a negative lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) immunohistochemistry and/or molecular confirmation by identified mutation in SPINK5. In this cohort, the most frequent histological finding was also psoriasiform hyperplasia, but there were additional, less common, or previously unreported findings, including compact parakeratosis with large nuclei, subcorneum or intracorneum splitting, presence of clear cells in the upper epidermis or stratum corneum, dyskeratosis, dermal infiltrate with neutrophils and/or eosinophils, and dilated blood vessels in the superficial dermis. An early confirmation of the diagnosis of NS is essential for improved patient management. Thus, in the situation of a patient with an unknown skin disorder and non specific clinical presentation, the dermatopathologist may now be able to suggest the diagnosis of NS based on these newly reported characteristics. However, LEKTI immunohistochemistry remains the essential diagnostic investigation in cases with misleading or nonspecific histological features and is mandatory for the definitive diagnosis of NS in all patients.

The disease is characterized by extensive skin desquamation, inflammation, allergic manifestations and hair shaft defects. NS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 encoding the LEKTI serine protease inhibitor. LEKTI deficiency results in unopposed activities of kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and aberrantly increased proteolysis in the epidermis. Spink5\u207b/\u207b mice recapitulate the NS phenotype, display enhanced epidermal Klk5 and Klk7 protease activities and die within a few hours after birth because of a severe skin barrier defect. However the contribution of these various proteases in the physiopathology remains to be determined. In this study, we developed a new murine model in which Klk5 and Spink5 were both knocked out to assess whether Klk5 deletion is sufficient to reverse the NS phenotype in Spink5\u207b/\u207b mice. By repeated intercrossing between Klk5\u207b/\u207b mice with Spink5\u207b/\u207b mice, we generated Spink5\u207b/\u207bKlk5\u207b/\u207b animals. We showed that Klk5 knock-out in Lekti-deficient newborn mice rescues neonatal lethality, reverses the severe skin barrier defect, restores epidermal structure and prevents skin inflammation. Specifically, using in situ zymography and specific protease substrates, we showed that Klk5 knockout reduced epidermal proteolytic activity, particularly its downstream targets proteases KLK7, KLK14 and ELA2. By immunostaining, western blot, histology and electron microscopy analyses, we provide evidence that desmosomes and corneodesmosomes remain intact and that epidermal differentiation is restored in Spink5\u207b/\u207bKlk5\u207b/\u207b. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses and immunostainings revealed absence of inflammation and allergy in Spink5\u207b/\u207bKlk5\u207b/\u207b skin. Notably, Il-1\u03b2, Il17A and Tslp levels were normalized. Our results provide in vivo evidence that KLK5 knockout is sufficient to reverse NS-like symptoms manifested in Spink5\u207b/\u207b skin.

It manifests at birth with generalized ichthyosiform erythroderma or with a collodion baby picture. The erythrodermic and ichthyotic phenotype persists during life and its severity may modify. However, the hallmark of the disease is the appearance, in childhood or later in life, of healthy skin confetti-like spots, which increase in number and size with time. IWC is a very rare genodermatosis, with a prevalence <1/1,000,000 and only 40 cases reported worldwide. The most important associated clinical features include ear deformities, mammillae hypoplasia, palmoplantar keratoderma, hypertrichosis and ectropion. IWC is due to dominant negative mutations in the KRT10 and KRT1 genes, encoding for keratins 10 and keratin 1, respectively. In this context, healthy skin confetti-like spots represent \"repaired\" skin due to independent events of reversion of keratin gene mutations via mitotic recombination. In most cases, IWC clinical suspicion is delayed until the detection of white skin spots. Clinical features, which may represent hint to the diagnosis of IWC even before appearance of confetti-like spots, include ear and mammillae hypoplasia, the progressive development of hypertrichosis and, in some patients, of adherent verrucous plaques of hyperkeratosis. Altogether the histopathological finding of keratinocyte vacuolization and the nuclear staining for keratin 10 and keratin 1 by immunofluorescence are pathognomonic. Nevertheless, mutational analysis of KRT10 or KRT1 genes is at present the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis. IWC has to be differentiated mainly from congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Differential diagnosis also includes syndromic ichthyoses, in particular Netherton syndrome, and the keratinopathic ichthyoses. Most of reported IWC cases are sporadic, but familial cases with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance have been also described. Therefore, knowledge of the mutation is the only way to properly counsel the couples. No specific and satisfactory therapy is currently available for IWC. Like for other congenital ichthyoses, topical treatments (mainly emollients and keratolytics) are symptomatic and offer only temporary relief. Among systemic treatments, retinoids, in particular acitretin, improve disease symptoms in most patients. Although at present there is no curative therapy for ichthyoses, treatments have improved considerably over the years and the best therapy for each patient is always the result of both physician and patient efforts.

Mutations in genes encoding for desmosomal components have recently been shown to cause three clinically overlapping entities: peeling skin disease; severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting syndrome; and Netherton syndrome. Mutations in keratin 10 have been identified as the cause of ichthyosis with confetti, a rare form of ichthyosis characterized by severe erythroderma in which healthy spots gradually develop since childhood. There is no curative treatment for the congenital ichthyoses. A recent systematic review of randomized clinical trials of ichthyosis treatments revealed that research evidence of therapy is poor. The expanding phenotype and genotype of the ichthyoses facilitates accurate clinical diagnosis and permits a deeper knowledge of the epidermal pathophysiology.

In healthy human epidermis, the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin (LL-37) and human \u03b2-defensin 2 (HBD2), as well as the desquamatory protease kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7), are delivered to the stratum corneum (SC) interstices by lamellar body (LB) exocytosis. To assess whether abnormalities in the LB secretory system could account for increased risk of infections and impaired desquamation in inherited ichthyoses with known abnormalities in LB assembly (Harlequin ichthyosis [HI]), secretion (epidermolytic ichthyosis [EI]), or postsecretory proteolysis (Netherton syndrome [NS]). Samples from library material were taken from patients with HI, EI, NS, and other ichthyoses, but with a normal LB secretory system, and in healthy controls and were evaluated by electron microscopy and immunohistochemical analysis from July 1, 2010, through March 31, 2013. Changes in LB secretion and in the fate of LB-derived enzymes and antimicrobial peptides in ichthyotic patients vs healthy controls. In healthy controls and patients with X-linked ichthyosis, neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis, and Gaucher disease, LB secretion is normal, and delivery of LB-derived proteins and LL-37 immunostaining persists high into the SC. In contrast, proteins loaded into nascent LBs and their delivery to the SC interstices decrease markedly in patients with HI, paralleled by reduced immunostaining for LL-37, HBD2, and KLK7 in the SC. In patients with EI, the cytoskeletal abnormality impairs the exocytosis of LB contents and thus results in decreased LL-37, HBD2, and KLK7 secretion, causing substantial entombment of these proteins within the corneocyte cytosol. Finally, in patients with NS, although abundant enzyme proteins loaded in parallel with accelerated LB production, LL-37 disappears, whereas KLK7 levels increase markedly in the SC. Together, these results suggest that diverse abnormalities in the LB secretory system account for the increased risk of secondary infections and impaired desquamation in patients with HI, EI, and NS.", "keywords": [], "year": 2015, "doi": "10.1001/jamadermatol.2014.3369"}

In two inflammatory skin diseases, atopic eczema and Netherton syndrome, an increased level of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) has been observed as opposed to healthy skin. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of MUFAs on the lipid organization and skin lipid barrier using an in vitro model membrane system, the stratum corneum substitute (SCS), mimicking the SC lipid composition and organization. To achieve our goal, the SCS has been prepared with increasing levels of MUFAs using various chain length. Permeation studies and trans-epidermal water loss measurements show that an increment of MUFAs reduces the lipid barrier in the SCS. The increased level of unsaturation exerts its effect by reducing the packing density in the lipid organization, while the lamellar phases are not affected. Our findings indicate that increased levels of MUFAs may contribute to the impaired skin barrier in diseased skin. ", "keywords": [], "year": 2014, "doi": "10.1021/la500972w"}

All three result in allergies to multiple allergens due to severe barrier impairment. Conversely, impaired corneodesmosomal degradation due to matriptase mutations could lead to ichthyosis.

To address the role of KLK5 in NS, we have generated a new transgenic murine model expressing human KLK5 in the granular layer of the epidermis (Tg-KLK5). Transgene expression resulted in increased proteolytic activity attributable to KLK5 and its downstream targets KLK7, KLK14, and ELA2. Tg-KLK5 mice developed an exfoliative erythroderma with scaling, growth delay, and hair abnormalities. The skin barrier was defective and the stratum corneum was detached through desmosomal cleavage. Importantly, Tg-KLK5 mice displayed cutaneous and systemic hallmarks of severe inflammation and allergy with pruritus. The skin showed enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, infiltration of immune cells, and markers of Th2/Th17/Th22 T cell responses.

We studied the SC lipid composition by means of mass spectrometry, and the lipid organization was examined by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Decreased free fatty acid (FFA) chain length and increased levels of monounsaturated FFAs were observed in the SC of NTS patients compared with controls. Furthermore, the level of short-chain ceramides (CERs) was enhanced in NTS patients and a strong reduction in long-chain CER levels was seen in several patients. The changes in lipid composition modified the lipid organization leading to an increased disordering of the lipids compared with the controls. In addition, in a subgroup of patients the organization of the lipid layers changed dramatically. The altered FFA and CER profiles in NTS patients corresponded to changes in the expression of enzymes involved in SC lipid processing. The observed changes in lipid composition, lipid organization, and enzyme expression are likely to contribute to the barrier dysfunction in NTS.

NS is due to loss-of-function mutations in the SPINK5 gene and to the consequent lack of expression of its encoded protein LEKTI in the skin and all stratified epithelial tissues. Following the identification of the NS causative gene and protein, specific diagnostic tools have been developed, thus breaking up the challenge of distinguishing NS from other congenital ichthyoses with overlapping features, and from severe, early-onset forms of atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Intensive efforts to extend the knowledge into the pathomechanisms of NS have also been made. However, NS management is still problematic due to the lack of specific treatment and unmet needs.

NS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 (serine protease inhibitor of kazal type 5) encoding LEKTI-1 (lympho-epithelial kazal type related inhibitor type 5) expressed in stratified epithelia. In vitro and in vivo studies in murine models and in NS patients have cast light on the pathogenesis of the disease and shown that LEKTI deficiency results in unopposed kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) and KLK7 activities and to the overactivity of a new epidermal protease, elastase 2 (ELA2). Two main cascades initiated by KLK5 activity have emerged. One results in desmoglein 1 degradation and desmosome cleavage leading to stratum corneum detachment. KLK5 also activates KLK7 and ELA2, which contribute to a defective skin barrier. This facilitates allergen and microbe penetration and generates danger signals leading to caspase 1 activation and the production of active interleukin-1\u03b2. In parallel, KLK5 activates a specific cascade of allergy and inflammation by activating protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) receptors. PAR-2 activation triggers the production of the major pro-Th2 cytokine TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin) and several inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. Levels of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) also contribute to allergy in a PAR-2-independent manner. Patient investigations have confirmed these abnormalities and revealed a wide spectrum of disease expression, sometimes associated with residual LEKTI expression. These results have demonstrated that the tight regulation of epidermal protease activity is essential for skin homeostasis and identified new targets for therapeutic intervention.

Loss-of-function mutations in the LEKTI encoding gene SPINK5 cause Netherton syndrome, a rare and severe genetic skin disease with a profound skin barrier defect and atopic manifestations. Several studies also reported genetic association between the multifactorial disease atopic dermatitis (AD) and a frequent and non-conservative LEKTI variant, E420K, in different populations. Here, we provide evidence that the 420K variant impacts on LEKTI function by increasing the likelihood of furin-dependent LEKTI precursor cleavage within the linker region D6-D7. This results in the reversal of the cleavage priorities for LEKTI proteolytic activation and prevents the formation of the LEKTI fragment D6D9 known to display the strongest inhibitory activity against kallikrein (KLK) 5-mediated desmoglein-1 (DSG1) degradation. Using in situ and gel zymographies, we show that the modification of the subtle balance in LEKTI inhibitory fragments leads to enhanced KLK5, KLK7 and elastase-2 (ELA-2) activities in 420KK epidermis. By immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses, we found that increased epidermal protease activity correlates with reduced DSG1 protein expression and accelerated profilaggrin proteolysis. All changes determined by the presence of residue 420K within the LEKTI sequence likely contribute to defective skin barrier permeability. Remarkably, LEKTI 420KK epidermis displays an increased expression of the proallergic cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).

Inhibitory assays confirmed that binding on the protein array surface corresponded directly to levels of inhibition. The method was then tested using skin epidermal extracts.

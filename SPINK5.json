Ablation of Camp in Spink5-/- suppressed epidermal inflammation and restored abnormal epidermal differentiation, nevertheless, it failed to inhibit overdesquamation and Spink5-/-Camp-/- succumbed perinatally due to skin barrier defect, similarly to Spink5-/-. Joint invalidation of Klk5 and Camp significantly extended survival of Spink5-/-Klk5-/-Camp-/- mice. We provide evidence that cathelicidin is implicated in NS-associated skin inflammation in vivo.

The chronicity and severity of NS adversely affects a patient's quality of life to a large extent. It Is therefore important that this condition is identified early, and treatment to reduce cutaneous inflammation is initiated in a timely fashion. However, due to this condition being relatively rare, a lack of awareness may lead clinicians to misdiagnose it as atopic dermatitis or undifferentiated psoriasis. Clinicians should therefore be aware of the peripheral stigmata that this disease may present as in adulthood, so that a correct diagnosis can be made if it was previously missed. Here we present a case of two male siblings from Jordon who were misdiagnosed since childhood as having erythrodermic psoriasis.

This study aimed to show the roles of C/EBP\u03b1 in the distal airway during chronic cigarette smoke (CS) exposure in mice and in the small airways in smokers. In a model of chronic smoke exposure using epithelial cell-specific C/EBP\u03b1-knockout mice, significant pathological phenotypes, such as higher protease activity, impaired ciliated cell regeneration, epithelial cell barrier dysfunction via reduced Zo-1, and decreased alveolar attachments, were found in C/EBP\u03b1-knockout mice compared to control mice. We found that Spink5 gene (encoding Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI), an anti-serine protease) expression in the small airways is a key regulator of protease activity in this model. Finally, we showed that daily antiprotease treatment counteracted the phenotypes of C/EBP\u03b1-knockout mice. In human studies, CEBPA expression in the lung was downregulated in patients with emphysema, and 6 smokers with centrilobular emphysema (CLE) showed a significant reduction in LEKTI in the small airways compared to 22 non-CLE smokers.

A 15-year-old male with NS was referred with suspicion of acute leukemia. Severe anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated CRP level were demonstrated in pre-hospital laboratory tests. Physical examination revealed generalized ichthyosiform erythroderma. ALL was diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow biopsy. The patient was initially classified as CNS3 status. No signals indicating fusion of BCR/ABL1, ETV6, and RUNX1 genes and MLL gene rearrangement were found in the cytogenetic analysis. The patient was qualified for chemotherapy and treated according to ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocol for high-risk ALL. During induction therapy, severe skin toxicity occurred (WHO grade III), which prompted the modification of treatment down to intermediate-risk strategy. In the course of reinduction therapy, severe chemotherapy-induced adverse drug reactions occurred, including progression of skin toxicity to WHO grade IV. The patient achieved complete remission. In view of life-threatening toxicities and the confirmed complete remission, intensive chemotherapy regimen was discontinued and maintenance treatment was started. Because of the baseline CNS3 status, the patient received cranial radiotherapy. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify disease-associated mutations. WES revealed two germline mutations: a novel premature termination variant in SPINK5 (p.Cys510*), along with a novel potentially pathogenic variant in NUP214 (p.Arg815Gln). Somatic mutations were known pathogenic variants of JAK2 (p.Arg683Gly), IL17RC (p.Ala303Thr), and potentially pathogenic non-synonymous variants of TTN (p.Gly1091Arg and p.Pro17245Leu), ACTN2 (p.Ile143Leu), TRPV3 (p.Arg729*), and COL7A1 (p.Glu2842fs) genes. Currently, the patient continues maintenance chemotherapy, with stable status of skin lesions and no features of ALL relapse. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ALL in a patient with NS. As has been presented, in such patients, optimal treatment according to the current protocols is extremely difficult. WES was used to confirm the diagnosis of Ph-like ALL in our patient. The detection of JAK2 gene mutation offers the possibility of therapy personalization.

Netherton syndrome (NS, MIM256500) is an autosomal recessive disorder that includes ichthyosis linearis circumflexa and a predisposition to allergies, asthma, and eczema, with hypereosinophilia, trichorrhexis invaginata, and elevated serum IgE levels. The genetic bases of Netherton syndrome are mutations in the gene SPINK5, and the Lymphoepitheial Kazal type related inhibitor, a serine protease inhibitor, is encoded by SPINK. Here a case is presented which showed a probable splice site mutation in SPINK5, which was previously unknown in databases and the literature, to point out the misdiagnosis of Hyper IgE Syndrome in the early presentation of the phenotype. This case highlights that a genetic test can be critical for identifying NS. The finding of underlying mutations contributes to the understanding of Netherton syndrome and is instrumental in indicating a specific therapy. Notably, treatment with acitretin has significantly improved both the ichthyosis linearis circumflexa and eczema in our patient.", "keywords": ["Netherton syndrome", "eczema", "hyper IgE syndrome", "ichthyosis", "serum IgE"], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.24953/turkjped.2019.04.020"}

Phenotypes were scored for severity of skin condition, specific hair shaft defects, atopy, and recurrent infections.

Consumption was estimated at 7.2kg per year. On examination, she had osteoporosis, Cushing's syndrome, corticotropic insufficiency and inframammary, axillary, and intergluteal superinfected intertrigo. During hospitalization for necrotic leg wounds on severe skin atrophy, she sustained a fracture on falling down. The course was marked by the onset of septic shock of unknown etiology, complicated by acute adrenal insufficiency leading to fatal multi-organ failure. Many iatrogenic cases related to topical corticosteroids in children have been reported in the literature, including one case of fatal outcome (CMV infection) in an infant. Such iatrogenic cases are rarer in adults and we observed no fatal cases. In NS, the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are amplified due to the major defect in the skin barrier which enhances the systemic passage of these drugs. In the absence of any effective therapeutic alternative, weaning patients off topical corticosteroids is usually difficult. This case illustrates the severity of iatrogenic effects secondary to misuse of topical corticosteroids in NS as well as the need to find effective new treatments for this syndrome.", "keywords": ["Adrenal insufficiency", "Cushing syndrome", "Dermocortico\u00efdes", "Insuffisance surr\u00e9nalienne", "Netherton syndrome", "Osteoporosis", "Ost\u00e9oporose", "Syndrome de Cushing", "Syndrome de Netherton", "Topical steroids"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.annder.2019.09.003"}

Of the 17,097 genes analyzed, 357 were differentially expressed between ever smokers and never smokers (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), including 290 genes that were up-regulated and 67 down-regulated in ever smokers.

Smoking-induced up-regulation of six of these genes was also observed in a transcription dataset from lung tissue of non-cancer patients. Among the three most significant gene networks, two are involved in immunity and inflammation and one in cell death.

Spink5-/- mice die within 5h from birth due to their severe skin barrier defect leading to dehydration. Spink5-/- mice also serve as a model for atopic dermatitis.

The phenotype was assessed by macroscopic observation, immunohistochemistry for differentiation markers, in situ zymography for proteolysis, and quantification of proinflammatory cytokines. Elimination of Klk6 in Spink5-/- remarkably suppresses the expression of Tslp, a major itching-inducing factor and driver of allergic reactions. Tnf\u03b1 and the Th17 promoting cytokine Il-23 were also suppressed. Spink5-/-Klk6-/- mice display normalized keratinocyte differentiation, nevertheless, epidermal proteolytic activities and the associated overdesquamation were not ameliorated, and Spink5-/-Klk6-/- still died from a severe epidermal barrier defect as the Spink5-/-. Ablation of Klk6 largely suppresses epidermal inflammation but cannot rescue overdesquamation leading to the lethal NS phenotype.

It is not clear whether the beneficial effects of Azm are due to its anti-microbial activity or other pharmacological actions. We have shown that Azm affects the integrity of the bronchial epithelial barrier measured by increased transepithelial electrical resistance. To better understand these effects of Azm on bronchial epithelia we have investigated global changes in gene expression. VA10 bronchial epithelial cells were treated with Azm and cultivated in air-liquid interface conditions for up to 22\u2009days. RNA was isolated at days 4, 10 and 22 and analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing. qPCR and immunostaining were used to confirm key findings from bioinformatic analyses. Detailed assessment of cellular changes was done using microscopy, followed by characterization of the lipidomic profiles of the multivesicular bodies present. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that after 10\u2009days of treatment genes encoding effectors of sterol and cholesterol metabolism were prominent. Interestingly, expression of genes associated with epidermal barrier differentiation, KRT1, CRNN, SPINK5 and DSG1, increased significantly at day 22. Together with immunostaining, these results suggest an epidermal differentiation pattern. We also found that Azm induced the formation of multivesicular and lamellar bodies in two different airway epithelial cell lines. Lipidomic analysis revealed that Azm was entrapped in multivesicular bodies linked to different types of lipids, most notably palmitate and stearate. Furthermore, targeted analysis of lipid species showed accumulation of phosphatidylcholines, as well as ceramide derivatives. Taken together, we demonstrate how Azm might confer its barrier enhancing effects, via activation of epidermal characteristics and changes to intracellular lipid dynamics. These effects of Azm could explain the unexpected clinical benefit observed during Azm-treatment of patients with various lung diseases affecting barrier function.", "keywords": ["Air-liquid interface", "Airway", "Azithromycin", "Epidermal differentiation", "Epithelia", "Gene expression"], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.1186/s12931-019-1101-3"}

Here, we describe the case of a female infant with severe immune dysregulation leading to recurrent systemic infections, failure to thrive and severe crises of ichthyosiform erythroderma with high levels of serum IgE. Hence, initial symptoms indicated Netherton syndrome or Omenn syndrome. Surprisingly, sequence analyses of SPINK5 and RAG1/RAG2, respectively, excluded these diseases. During the hospital stay the patient's health deteriorated, despite intensive care therapy, and she died. In order to delineate the diagnosis, whole-exome sequencing was performed. Two compound heterozygous mutations in MALT1 were found and verified by Sanger sequencing (exon 2 c.245T>C, exon 2 c.310dup), which led to a MALT1 deficiency at the protein level. Based on these results, an immunological analysis was performed, as was immunofluorescence staining of key skin proteins, to confirm a diagnosis of MALT1 deficiency. This case report provides a closer description of the clinical and histological skin phenotype of MALT1 deficiency, and we conclude that MALT1 deficiency must be considered a possible differential diagnosis of Netherton and Omenn syndromes. What's already known about this topic? Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) deficiency is a combined immunodeficiency. MALT1 is part of the caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11-B-cell lymphoma 10-MALT1 signalosome complex, which is essential for nuclear factor kappa B activation. Current publications describe a phenotype of recurrent systemic infections; only in a few cases has an inflammatory involvement of the integument been described. What does this study add? A closer description of the cutaneous phenotype of MALT1 deficiency in a patient with two novel MALT1 mutations. Immune mapping of follicular epidermis shows lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor is reduced in MALT1 deficiency and absent on interfollicular staining. Clinically, MALT1 deficiency mimics Netherton syndrome and Omenn syndrome, and should be considered a differential diagnosis.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1111/bjd.18091"}

Recent studies suggest that the expression of TJ molecules and epithelial barrier function in human nasal epithelium are modulated by various internal and external factors. This review summarizes recent advances regarding the structure, function, and regulating mechanisms of the epithelial physical barrier in the context of CRS. Expert opinion: Available data indicate that epithelial physical barrier defects in CRS can result from inhaled allergens, microbial or virus infections, cytokines, hypoxia, or zinc deficiency, among other causes. Several genes/molecules, such as SPINK5, S100A7, S100A8/9, PCDH1, NDRG1, SPRR, and p63 are involved in modulating the physical barrier function in the context of CRS. The exact mechanisms and molecular pathways that lead to these barrier defects, however, require additional study.

Further studies have found that SPINK5 is closely related to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by bioinformatics analysis and western blot. In esophageal cancer cells, SPINK5 overexpression can inhibit Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

About 85% of AD cases begin in childhood, a significant portion of which can persist into adulthood. Moreover, a typical progression of children with AD to food allergy, asthma or allergic rhinitis has been reported (\"allergic march\" or \"atopic march\"). AD comprises highly heterogeneous sub-phenotypes/endotypes resulting from complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as environmental stimuli, and genetic factors regulating cutaneous functions (impaired barrier function, epidermal lipid, and protease abnormalities), immune functions and the microbiome. Though the roles of high-throughput \"omics\" integrations in defining endotypes are recognized, current analyses are primarily based on individual omics data and using binary clinical outcomes. Although individual omics analysis, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), can effectively map variants correlated with AD, the majority of the heritability and the functional relevance of discovered variants are not explained or known by the identified variants. The limited success of singular approaches underscores the need for holistic and integrated approaches to investigate complex phenotypes using trans-omics data integration strategies. Integrating omics layers (e.g., genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome, exposome, microbiome), which often have complementary and synergistic effects, might provide the opportunity to capture the flow of information underlying AD disease manifestation. Overlapping genes/candidates derived from multiple omics types include FLG, SPINK5, S100A8, and SERPINB3 in AD pathogenesis. Overlapping pathways include macrophage, endothelial cell and fibroblast activation pathways, in addition to well-known Th1/Th2 and NFkB activation pathways. Interestingly, there was more multi-omics overlap at the pathway level than gene level. Further analysis of multi-omics overlap at the tissue level showed that among 30 tissue types from the GTEx database, skin and esophagus were significantly enriched, indicating the biological interconnection between AD and food allergy. The present work explores multi-omics integration and provides new biological insights to better define the biological basis of AD etiology and confirm previously reported AD genes/pathways. In this context, we also discuss opportunities and challenges introduced by \"big omics data\" and their integration.", "keywords": ["atopic dermatitis", "bioinformatics", "biomarkers", "endotypes", "machine learning", "multi-omics integration", "network analysis", "omics"], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2018.02727"}

Female sex, older age, late onset, self-reported personal or family history of ACD, and presence of prurigo nodularis were associated with concurrent ACD in AD patients. Age was useful for predicting concurrent ACD based on the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, no differences in the frequency of genetic variants were identified between the two groups. A personal or family history of ACD, late onset, and prurigo nodularis support a suspicion of concurrent ACD, although these correlations were less apparent after correcting for age and sex.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns or damage-associated molecular patterns and produce inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides. However, the effect of TLR signaling on the expression of LEKTI is not clear. To investigate whether TLR signaling can affect expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes. We stimulated a panel of TLR ligands and investigated the expression of LEKTI in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). We further measured trypsin or chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity in NHEK cultured media under stimulation with TLR3 ligand, poly (I:C). Immunostaining for LEKTI was performed using skin samples from skin infectious diseases. TLR1/2, 3, 5, and 2/6 ligands induced the expression of LEKTI in NHEKs. The trypsin or chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity in NHEKs was up-regulated with the stimulation of poly (I:C). The gene expressions of KLK6, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK13 were also increased by poly (I:C). An immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression of LEKTI was up-regulated in the lesions of varicella, pyoderma, and rosacea.

DNA methylation dataset GSE41114 and gene expression dataset GSE74530 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The global methylation status of OSCC tumor samples and normal control samples was determined, and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in OSCC samples compared with control samples were identified. The mRNA expression data were then integrated to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OSCC samples compared with control samples. Overlapping genes between DEGs and DMGs were identified, and functional enrichment analysis was performed. In addition, survival analysis of the overlapping genes was performed to screen genes with prognostic significance in OSCC. A total of 40,115 differential methylation CpG sites spanning 3,360 DMGs were identified; CpG sites in the promoter, gene body and intergenic regions were generally highly hypermethylated or hypomethylated.

Update and familiarity with these clinical features will help to make a better diagnose, assessment and treatment of HIES. Although hyper serum IgE levels have been identified in PGM3 deficiency and Comel-Netherton syndrome, PGM3 and SPINK5 genes were not included in the list of genetic etiologies of AR-HIES by the Expert Committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies until 2015. The identification of these HIES-causing genes greatly promoted the pathogenic mechanism studies of HIES. Also, in recent years, more clinical manifestations, which were often not of concern in HIES patients, have been shown to be highly related to HIES. For example, a significantly high frequency of vascular and gastrointestinal abnormities has been reported in STAT3-deficient AD-HIES patients. These new findings might help to provide new clues to the functional study of these HIES-related genes. This review summarizes and compares the major clinical manifestations of different subtypes of HIES, and we suggest that the incidence and severity of otitis media should not be underestimated in HIES patients.", "keywords": ["Clinical manifestation", "Cutaneous manifestations", "Different genetic etiologies", "Hyper IgE syndrome", "Infections", "Otitis media"], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.1007/s11882-018-0806-6"}

This can result in diagnostic delay and worsen prognosis. Within increasing access to \"clinical-exome\" testing, clinicians need to be aware of the implication and rationale for genetic testing, including the benefits and limitations of current therapies. Extreme elevation of serum IgE has been associated with a growing number of PID syndromes including the novel CARD11 and ZNF341 deficiencies. Variable elevations in IgE are associated with defects in innate, humoral, cellular and combined immunodeficiency syndromes. Barrier compromise can closely phenocopy these conditions.

important role in eliciting type 2 immune responses, yet the molecular events that initiate and connect this with allergic inflammation remain unclear. We reveal an endogenous, homeostatic mechanism that controls barrier function and inflammatory responses in esophageal allergic inflammation. We show that a serine protease inhibitor, SPINK7 (serine peptidase inhibitor, kazal type 7), is part of the differentiation program of human esophageal epithelium and that SPINK7 depletion occurs in a human allergic, esophageal condition termed eosinophilic esophagitis. Experimental manipulation strategies reducing SPINK7 in an esophageal epithelial progenitor cell line and primary esophageal epithelial cells were sufficient to induce barrier dysfunction and transcriptional changes characterized by loss of cellular differentiation and altered gene expression known to stimulate allergic responses (for example, FLG and SPINK5). Epithelial silencing of SPINK7 promoted production of proinflammatory cytokines including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Loss of SPINK7 increased the activity of urokinase plasminogen-type activator (uPA), which in turn had the capacity to promote uPA receptor-dependent eosinophil activation. Treatment of epithelial cells with the broad-spectrum antiserine protease, \u03b11 antitrypsin, reversed the pathologic features associated with SPINK7 silencing. The relevance of this pathway in vivo was supported by finding genetic epistasis between variants in TSLP and the uPA-encoding gene, PLAU We propose that the endogenous balance between SPINK7 and its target proteases is a key checkpoint in regulating mucosal differentiation, barrier function, and inflammatory responses and that protein replacement with antiproteases may be therapeutic for select allergic diseases.", "keywords": [], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.aap9736"}

We carried out REBA to simultaneously detect variations in genes related to barrier or immune function, namely, FLG, SPINK5, KLK7, DEFB1, TNF\u03b1, KDR, FCER1A, IL4, IL5,IL5RA, IL9, IL10, IL12, IL12R, IL13 and IL18, from Korean patients with AD, and compared the variation to that in nonatopic healthy controls. The homozygous mutants of KLK7 and SPINK5-2475, and the heterozygous mutants of FLG 3321delA, SPINK5-1156, DEFB1, KDR, IL5RA, IL9 and IL12RB1 were significantly more frequent in AD. It has been predicted that the larger the number of gene variants, the higher the odds ratio of AD prevalence; however, we did not find any significant correlation between the number of gene variants and AD severity. Using REBA, we identified more genetic variants that can predict AD occurrence. We also verified that REBA can be used to easily and accurately detect multiple AD-related gene variants simultaneously. In addition, we identified a correlation between KLK7 mutation and AD in Koreans, which is the first such report, to our knowledge.", "keywords": [], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.1111/ced.13367"}

Differential expression and survival analysis were performed with validations from Human Protein Atlas and an independent cohort of 110 ESCC patients by immunohistochemistry staining. We identified a total of 186 significantly dysregulated genes in ESCC, including downregulated genes SPINK5, IL1RN and upregulated genes SPP1 and PLAU, which were further confirmed in Human Protein Atlas data. Moreover, nine immune related genes (ABL1, ATF2, ATG5, C6, CD38, HMGB1, ICOSLG, IL12RB2 and PLAU) were significantly associated with patients' overall survival, among which, prognostic model was built including three independent factors ABL1, CD38 and ICOSLG. Validation by immunohistochemistry staining suggested that combination with tumor infiltrated CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes would yield higher performance in distinguishing cases as high or low risk of unfavorable prognosis. In summary, we profiled the immune status in ESCC and established predictive and prognostic factors for ESCC, which could reflect immune disorders within tumor microenvironments and independently distinguish patients with a high risk of reduced survival, providing novel predictive and therapeutic targets for ESCC patients in the future.", "keywords": ["ABL1", "CD38", "ICOSLG", "esophageal squamous cell carcinoma", "immune", "prognosis", "tumor-infiltrated lymphocyte"], "year": 2017, "doi": "10.1080/2162402X.2017.1356147"}

To assess the effects of miR-32 in\u00a0vivo, we developed transgenic mice overexpressing miR-32 in the prostate. The study indicated that transgenic miR-32 expression increases replicative activity in the prostate epithelium. We further observed an aging-associated increase in the incidence of goblet cell metaplasia in the prostate epithelium. Furthermore, aged miR-32 transgenic mice exhibited metaplasia-associated prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia at a low frequency. When crossbred with mice lacking the other allele of tumor-suppressor Pten (miR-32xPten+/- mice), miR-32 expression increased both the incidence and the replicative activity of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions in the dorsal prostate. The miR-32xPten+/- mice also demonstrated increased goblet cell metaplasia compared with Pten+/- mice. By performing a microarray analysis of mouse prostate tissue to screen downstream targets and effectors of miR-32, we identified RAC2 as a potential, and clinically relevant, target of miR-32. We also demonstrate down-regulation of several interesting, potentially prostate cancer-relevant genes (Spink1, Spink5, and Casp1) by miR-32 in the prostate tissue. The results demonstrate that miR-32 increases proliferation and promotes metaplastic transformation in mouse prostate epithelium, which may promote neoplastic alterations in the prostate.", "keywords": [], "year": 2017, "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2017.07.012"}

At baseline, 57 genes were differentially expressed between asthmatics and controls, and the asthmatics had decreased expression of viral replication inhibitors and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation.

At this time point, asthmatics lacked an increase in IL-10 signaling observed in the controls. At 7 days following HRV inoculation, 222 genes were significantly dysregulated in the asthmatics, whereas only 4 genes were dysregulated among controls.

Additionally, the in vitro effects of recombinant EPIs on the secretion of the epithelial-derived cytokines IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in airway epithelial cells, and the in vivo effects of recombinant EPIs in the nasal epithelium of mice exposed to multiple airborne allergens (MAA) were examined. Compared with control subjects and patients with noneosinophilic CRS, patients with eosinophilic CRS showed significantly lower protein and mRNA expression of cystatin A and SPINK5 in the nasal epithelium. Allergen-induced production of IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in normal human bronchial epithelial cells was inhibited by treatment with recombinant cystatin A or SPINK5. Conversely, the production of these cytokines was increased when cystatin A or SPINK5 were knocked down with small interfering RNA. Chronic MAA exposure induced goblet cell metaplasia and epithelial disruption in mouse nasal epithelium and decreased the tissue expression and nasal lavage levels of cystatin A and SPINK5. Intranasal instillations of recombinant EPIs attenuated this MAA-induced pathology. Cystatin A and SPINK5 play an important role in protecting the airway epithelium from exogenous proteases.

Netherton syndrome has been proposed to be a primary immunodeficiency syndrome because of the high frequency of infections. The precise mechanisms underlying the disease are not fully understood. To study the association of the SPINK5 mutation with the NS phenotype and the extent of immunologic deficiencies in NS. Relevant tissue samples and follow-up data from 11 patients with NS from 7 families, including 3 multiplex families, were collected, constituting all known patients with NS in Finland. Another patient with NS from a neighboring country was included. Data were collected from August 10, 2011, to February 20, 2015. SPINK5 mutations were sequenced, and thorough clinical evaluation and histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluations of skin samples were performed. The function of natural killer cells, lymphocyte phenotype, and serum immunoglobulin subclass levels were evaluated. Data analysis was conducted from October 19, 2011, to February 20, 2015. The nature of SPINK5 mutations and their correlation with phenotypes in Finnish patients with NS, intrafamilial phenotype variations, and the type of immunologic defects in NS were evaluated. Among the 11 Finnish patients with NS (8 male [73%]; 3 female [27%]; mean [SD] age, 30.1 [9.1] years), a Finnish founder mutation c.652C>T (p.Arg218*) in SPINK5 was identified in 10 patients from 6 families who all originated from the same region. Eight patients were homozygotes for this mutation and 2 siblings were compound heterozygotes with a splice site mutation c.1220 + 1G>C (IVS13 + 1 G>C). Phenotypes were comparable, but some intrafamilial and interfamilial variations were noted. Compound heterozygous patients had a milder phenotype and showed residual LEKTI expression. A previously unreported c.1772delT (p.Leu591Glnfs124*) mutation was found in 1 patient with a phenotype similar to the patients homozygous for the founder mutation. The patient from the neighboring country had a distinct phenotype and different mutations. Immunologically, natural killer cells had an immature phenotype and impaired cytotoxicity and degranulation, levels of memory B cells were reduced, and serum IgG4 levels were elevated.

The histological features of skin biopsies, usually described as a psoriasiform hyperplasia, have only been reported in isolated case reports or small case series. The aim of this study is to define, for the first time, the precise histological pattern of cutaneous lesions, in a large cohort of skin biopsies from confirmed NS patients. The study included 80 consecutive skin biopsies from 67 patients taken between January 1995 and June 2014. All were from confirmed NS patients with either a negative lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) immunohistochemistry and/or molecular confirmation by identified mutation in SPINK5. In this cohort, the most frequent histological finding was also psoriasiform hyperplasia, but there were additional, less common, or previously unreported findings, including compact parakeratosis with large nuclei, subcorneum or intracorneum splitting, presence of clear cells in the upper epidermis or stratum corneum, dyskeratosis, dermal infiltrate with neutrophils and/or eosinophils, and dilated blood vessels in the superficial dermis. An early confirmation of the diagnosis of NS is essential for improved patient management. Thus, in the situation of a patient with an unknown skin disorder and non specific clinical presentation, the dermatopathologist may now be able to suggest the diagnosis of NS based on these newly reported characteristics. However, LEKTI immunohistochemistry remains the essential diagnostic investigation in cases with misleading or nonspecific histological features and is mandatory for the definitive diagnosis of NS in all patients.

Despite the presence of a large body of information, molecular biomarkers are not currently used in the diagnosis, treatment and management of patients for this group of cancer. Here, we have profiled expression of genes and microRNAs of larynx and hypopharynx tumors using high-throughput sequencing experiments. We found that matrix metalloproteinases along with SCEL, CRNN, KRT4, SPINK5, and TGM3 among others have significantly altered expression in these tumors. Alongside gene expression, the microRNAs hsa-miR-139, hsa-miR-203 and the hsa-miR-424/503 cluster have aberrant expression in these cancers. Using target genes for these microRNAs, we found the involvement of pathways linked to cell cycle, p53 signaling, and viral carcinogenesis significant (P-values 10(-13), 10(-9) and 10(-7) respectively). Finally, using an ensemble machine-learning tool, we discovered a unique 8-gene signature for this group of cancers that differentiates the group from the other tumor subsites of head and neck region. We investigated the role of promoter methylation in one of these genes, WIF1, and found no correlation between DNA methylation and down-regulation of WIF1. We validated our findings of gene expression, 8-gene signature and promoter methylation using q-PCR, data from TCGA and q-MSP respectively.

The disease is characterized by extensive skin desquamation, inflammation, allergic manifestations and hair shaft defects. NS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 encoding the LEKTI serine protease inhibitor. LEKTI deficiency results in unopposed activities of kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and aberrantly increased proteolysis in the epidermis. Spink5\u207b/\u207b mice recapitulate the NS phenotype, display enhanced epidermal Klk5 and Klk7 protease activities and die within a few hours after birth because of a severe skin barrier defect. However the contribution of these various proteases in the physiopathology remains to be determined. In this study, we developed a new murine model in which Klk5 and Spink5 were both knocked out to assess whether Klk5 deletion is sufficient to reverse the NS phenotype in Spink5\u207b/\u207b mice. By repeated intercrossing between Klk5\u207b/\u207b mice with Spink5\u207b/\u207b mice, we generated Spink5\u207b/\u207bKlk5\u207b/\u207b animals. We showed that Klk5 knock-out in Lekti-deficient newborn mice rescues neonatal lethality, reverses the severe skin barrier defect, restores epidermal structure and prevents skin inflammation. Specifically, using in situ zymography and specific protease substrates, we showed that Klk5 knockout reduced epidermal proteolytic activity, particularly its downstream targets proteases KLK7, KLK14 and ELA2. By immunostaining, western blot, histology and electron microscopy analyses, we provide evidence that desmosomes and corneodesmosomes remain intact and that epidermal differentiation is restored in Spink5\u207b/\u207bKlk5\u207b/\u207b. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses and immunostainings revealed absence of inflammation and allergy in Spink5\u207b/\u207bKlk5\u207b/\u207b skin. Notably, Il-1\u03b2, Il17A and Tslp levels were normalized. Our results provide in vivo evidence that KLK5 knockout is sufficient to reverse NS-like symptoms manifested in Spink5\u207b/\u207b skin. These findings illustrate the crucial role of protease regulation in skin homeostasis and inflammation, and establish KLK5 inhibition as a major therapeutic target for NS.", "keywords": [], "year": 2015, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1005389"}

Increasing evidences show the modern lifestyle (i.e., the hygiene hypothesis, Western diet) and other environmental factors such as pollution and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) lead to the increasing prevalence of AD with the development of industrialization.

SPINK5, KLK5 and KLK7 are three of the genes of a recently validated LNM-predicting gene expression profile in OSCC. This study evaluates their clinicopathological role and value as biomarkers in OSCC. Eighty-three patients with primary OSCC, treated surgically between 1996 and 2000, were included. Gene expression data were acquired from a previously reported study. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status was determined by an algorithm for HPV-16. Protein expression for KLK5, KLK7 and SPINK5 was semi-quantitatively determined in all 83 tumours by immunohistochemistry. All expression data were correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Concurrent loss of KLK5 and KLK7 correlates with worse disease-specific and overall survival (DSS and OS). Multivariate analysis proved that co-expression is an independent prognostic factor for DSS (p = 0.029) and OS (p = 0.001).

As enhanced serine protease activity has been implicated in the disease pathogenesis, we investigated the impact of the kallikreins KLK5 [stratum corneum trypsin-like enzyme (SCTE)] and KLK7 [stratum corneum chymotrypsin-like enzyme (SCCE)] on the SPINK5 knockdown phenotype by generating double knockdowns in the organotypic model. Knockdown of KLK5 or KLK7 partially ameliorated the epidermal architecture: increased epidermal thickness and expression of desmocollin 1 (DSC1), desmoglein 1 (DSG1) and (pro)filaggrin. Thus, inhibition of serine proteases KLK5 and KLK7 could be therapeutically beneficial in NS.", "keywords": ["Netherton syndrome", "kallikreins", "serine protease inhibitor of kazal type 5", "skin equivalent", "small interfering nucleic acids"], "year": 2014, "doi": "10.1111/exd.12451"}

We sought to determine independent and epistatic associations between filaggrin (FLG), serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene variants and childhood asthma. Using a candidate gene approach, we genotyped 29 variants in FLG, SPINK5, and TSLP in asthmatic, allergic, and nonallergic nonasthmatic white and black children participating in the well-phenotyped Greater Cincinnati Pediatric Clinic Repository. Associations with asthma were also assessed in 6 replication populations. We observed independent associations of variants in SPINK5 (P = .003) and TSLP (P = .006) with childhood asthma; a SPINK5 single nucleotide polymorphism was replicated. In subjects with 1 or more SPINK5 risk alleles, the absence of the TSLP protective minor alleles was associated with a significant increase in asthma (67% vs 53%, P = .0017). In contrast, the presence or absence of TSLP minor alleles did not affect asthma risk in subjects without the SPINK5 risk alleles. The SPINK5 and TSLP epistasis was replicated in a black population (P = .036) who did not display independent association with variants in these genes. Our results support epistasis between SPINK5 and TSLP, which contributes to childhood asthma. These findings emphasize the importance of using biology to inform analyses to identify genetic susceptibility to complex diseases. The results from our study have clinical relevance and support that the therapeutic effects of anti-TSLP therapy in asthmatic patients might be dependent on SPINK5 genotype.", "keywords": ["Childhood asthma", "epistasis", "genetic association", "skin-related genes"], "year": 2014, "doi": "10.1016/j.jaci.2014.03.037"}

Comprehensive gene expression analysis showed alterations of the cutaneous retinoid metabolism and retinoid-mediated signaling in allergic skin immune response. Notably, ATRA synthesis was increased as indicated by the elevated expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenases and increased levels of ATRA. Consequently, the expression pattern of genes downstream to RAR was altered. Furthermore, the increased ratio of Fabp5 vs. Crabp2 may indicate an up-regulation of the PPAR\u03b4 pathway in allergen-induced dermatitis in addition to the altered RAR signaling.

In vitro and in vivo studies in murine models and in NS patients have cast light on the pathogenesis of the disease and shown that LEKTI deficiency results in unopposed kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) and KLK7 activities and to the overactivity of a new epidermal protease, elastase 2 (ELA2). Two main cascades initiated by KLK5 activity have emerged. One results in desmoglein 1 degradation and desmosome cleavage leading to stratum corneum detachment. KLK5 also activates KLK7 and ELA2, which contribute to a defective skin barrier. This facilitates allergen and microbe penetration and generates danger signals leading to caspase 1 activation and the production of active interleukin-1\u03b2. In parallel, KLK5 activates a specific cascade of allergy and inflammation by activating protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) receptors. PAR-2 activation triggers the production of the major pro-Th2 cytokine TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin) and several inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. Levels of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) also contribute to allergy in a PAR-2-independent manner. Patient investigations have confirmed these abnormalities and revealed a wide spectrum of disease expression, sometimes associated with residual LEKTI expression. These results have demonstrated that the tight regulation of epidermal protease activity is essential for skin homeostasis and identified new targets for therapeutic intervention. They also provide a link with atopic dermatitis through deregulated protease activity, as recently supported by functional studies of the E420K LEKTI variant.", "keywords": [], "year": 2013, "doi": "10.1007/s00441-013-1558-1"}

Silencing of ZNF750 in Ca2+-induced HaCaT keratinocytes led to morphologically apparent arrest in the progression of late differentiation, as well as diminished apoptosis and sustained proliferation. ZNF750 knockdown cells presented with markedly reduced expression of epidermal late differentiation markers, including gene subsets of epidermal differentiation complex and skin barrier formation such as FLG, LOR, SPINK5, ALOX12B and DSG1, known to be mutated in various human skin diseases. Furthermore, overexpression of ZNF750 in undifferentiated cells induced terminal differentiation genes.

Loss-of-function mutations in the LEKTI encoding gene SPINK5 cause Netherton syndrome, a rare and severe genetic skin disease with a profound skin barrier defect and atopic manifestations. Several studies also reported genetic association between the multifactorial disease atopic dermatitis (AD) and a frequent and non-conservative LEKTI variant, E420K, in different populations. Here, we provide evidence that the 420K variant impacts on LEKTI function by increasing the likelihood of furin-dependent LEKTI precursor cleavage within the linker region D6-D7. This results in the reversal of the cleavage priorities for LEKTI proteolytic activation and prevents the formation of the LEKTI fragment D6D9 known to display the strongest inhibitory activity against kallikrein (KLK) 5-mediated desmoglein-1 (DSG1) degradation. Using in situ and gel zymographies, we show that the modification of the subtle balance in LEKTI inhibitory fragments leads to enhanced KLK5, KLK7 and elastase-2 (ELA-2) activities in 420KK epidermis. By immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses, we found that increased epidermal protease activity correlates with reduced DSG1 protein expression and accelerated profilaggrin proteolysis. All changes determined by the presence of residue 420K within the LEKTI sequence likely contribute to defective skin barrier permeability. Remarkably, LEKTI 420KK epidermis displays an increased expression of the proallergic cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).

Our results showed that rs2303070 T allele of SPINK5 (assuming recessive model; OR=3.58, 95% CI 1.63-7.84; P=0.0014) and rs7977932\u2003G allele of IL-31 (assuming recessive model; OR=18.25, 95% CI\u2003=3.27-101.94; P=0.0009) were associated with increased risks of developing atopic eczema, while rs6892205\u2003G allele of SPINK5 (assuming dominant model; OR=3.79, 95% CI 1.55-9.28; P=0.0036) was associated with the development of non-atopic hand dermatitis. In summary, our results showed that distinct SPINK5 and IL-31 gene variants were associated with the development of atopic eczema and non-atopic hand dermatitis. The barrier function, particularly those regulated by SPINK5, may play an important role in the development of both atopic eczema and non-atopic hand dermatitis.", "keywords": [], "year": 2011, "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0625.2011.01374.x"}

We have previously described efficient lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer to keratinocyte stem cells and the generation of human skin grafts for the inherited skin disease, Netherton syndrome, which arises due to mutations in serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5). Vectors incorporating an internal murine retroviral-derived promoter [spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV)] in combination with a codon-optimized SPINK5 transgene supported high levels of reconstitution and robust correction of skin architecture. Subsequent longer-term experiments have uncovered unanticipated silencing phenomena, with loss of SPINK5 gene expression over time. The inadvertent introduction of CpG sites during codon optimization appears to have rendered vectors susceptible to silencing due to methylation across the promoter-transgene boundary. Substitution of the methylation-susceptible SFFV promoter with a 572-bp minimal human involucrin promoter (INVOp), which encodes very few CpG sites, prevented repression of the SPINK5 transgene and resulted in durable and highly compartment-specific reconstitution of lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) in human skin grafted onto immunodeficient mice.

NS is caused by mutations in SPINK5 (Serine Protease INhibitor Kazal-type 5), which encodes LEKTI (LymphoEpithelial Kazal Type-related Inhibitor). Lack of LEKTI causes stratum corneum detachment secondary to epidermal proteases hyperactivity. Whereas a skin barrier defect is generally regarded as a major cause for atopy, we previously identified a cell-autonomous signaling cascade that triggers pro-Th2 cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) production in LEKTI-deficient epidermis. This signaling is initiated by unrestricted kallikrein 5 (KLK5) activity, which directly activates proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)-mediated expression of TSLP and favors a cutaneous proallergic microenvironment independently of the environment and of the adaptive immune system. To further confirm these results in vivo, we generated Spink5/Par2 double knockout (DKO) mice. At embryonic day 19.5, these mice display a dramatic decrease in TSLP expression, although stratum corneum detachment persists, confirming the role of the KLK5-PAR2 cascade in TSLP-mediated early proallergic signaling. However, deletion of Par2 in adult DKO-grafted skin does not rescue the inflammatory phenotype probably resulting from stratum corneum detachment. We conclude that several mechanisms trigger and maintain the inflammatory phenotype in NS. These include skin barrier impairment, mechanical stress secondary to stratum corneum detachment, as well as protease-induced proinflammatory and proallergic pathways, including PAR2-mediated overexpression of TSLP.", "keywords": [], "year": 2010, "doi": "10.1038/jid.2010.233"}

Herein, we identify SPINK6 as a selective inhibitor of KLKs in the skin. Unlike LEKTI but similar to LEKTI-2, SPINK6 possesses only one typical Kazal domain. Its mRNA was detected to be expressed at low levels in several tissues and was induced during keratinocyte differentiation. Natural SPINK6 was purified from human plantar stratum corneum extracts. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed SPINK6 expression in the stratum granulosum of human skin at various anatomical localizations and in the skin appendages, including sebaceous glands and sweat glands. SPINK6 expression was decreased in lesions of atopic dermatitis. Using KLK5, KLK7, KLK8, KLK14, thrombin, trypsin, plasmin, matriptase, prostasin, mast cell chymase, cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and chymotrypsin, inhibition with recombinant SPINK6 was detected only for KLK5, KLK7, and KLK14, with apparent K(i) values of 1.33, 1070, and 0.5 nm, respectively.

Significant associations with wheeze in the past year were detected in only four genes (IL4R, TLR4, MS4A2, TLR9, P<0.05), with per allele odds ratios generally <1.3. Variants in IL4R and TLR4 were also related to allergen-specific IgE, while polymorphisms in FCER1B (MS4A2) and TLR9 were not. There were also highly significant associations (P<0.001) between SPINK5 variants and visible eczema (but not IgE levels) and between IL13 variants and total IgE. Heterogeneity of effects across centres was rare, despite differences in allele frequencies. Despite the biological plausibility of IgE-related mechanisms in asthma, very few of the tested candidates showed evidence of association with both wheeze and increased IgE levels.

The associations with NPSR1 were stronger in those reporting a first attack of asthma before the age of 15, with statistically significant interactions with age of onset found for three SNPs. The evidence for ADAM33 and BHR and for an age-specific effect of two SNPs in DPP10 and asthma was weaker.

Lack of LEKTI causes stratum corneum detachment secondary to epidermal proteases hyperactivity. This skin barrier defect favors allergen absorption and is generally regarded as the underlying cause for atopy in NS. We show for the first time that the pro-Th2 cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), the thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, and the macrophage-derived chemokine are overexpressed in LEKTI-deficient epidermis. This is part of an original biological cascade in which unregulated kallikrein (KLK) 5 directly activates proteinase-activated receptor 2 and induces nuclear factor kappaB-mediated overexpression of TSLP, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL8. This proinflammatory and proallergic pathway is independent of the primary epithelial failure and is activated under basal conditions in NS keratinocytes. This cell-autonomous process is already established in the epidermis of Spink5(-/-) embryos, and the resulting proinflammatory microenvironment leads to eosinophilic and mast cell infiltration in a skin graft model in nude mice. Collectively, these data establish that uncontrolled KLK5 activity in NS epidermis can trigger atopic dermatitis (AD)-like lesions, independently of the environment and the adaptive immune system. They illustrate the crucial role of protease signaling in skin inflammation and point to new therapeutic targets for NS as well as candidate genes for AD and atopy.", "keywords": [], "year": 2009, "doi": "10.1084/jem.20082242"}

UVB irradiation significantly reduced the expression of SPINK5 and increased the expression of KLK5 and KLK7, as assessed by real-time PCR, and reduced the expression of LEKTI and increased the expression of SCTE and SCCE by Western blotting and/or immunofluorescence analysis. Protease activity, as assessed by in situ zymography, was enhanced in the epidermis following exposure to UVB irradiation compared with sham-irradiated epidermis. These results suggest that reduced expression of LEKTI and increased expression of SCCE and SCTE in human epidermal keratinocytes after UVB irradiation may contribute to desquamation of the stratum corneum.", "keywords": [], "year": 2009, "doi": "10.1016/j.jdermsci.2008.11.004"}

The etiology of this disorder is unknown, although symptoms are exacerbated by factors that trigger innate immune responses, such as the release of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides. Here we show that individuals with rosacea express abnormally high levels of cathelicidin in their facial skin and that the proteolytically processed forms of cathelicidin peptides found in rosacea are different from those present in normal individuals. These cathelicidin peptides are a result of a post-translational processing abnormality associated with an increase in stratum corneum tryptic enzyme (SCTE) in the epidermis. In mice, injection of the cathelicidin peptides found in rosacea, addition of SCTE, and increasing protease activity by targeted deletion of the serine protease inhibitor gene Spink5 each increases inflammation in mouse skin. The role of cathelicidin in enabling SCTE-mediated inflammation is verified in mice with a targeted deletion of Camp, the gene encoding cathelicidin. These findings confirm the role of cathelicidin in skin inflammatory responses and suggest an explanation for the pathogenesis of rosacea by demonstrating that an exacerbated innate immune response can reproduce elements of this disease.", "keywords": [], "year": 2007, "doi": "10.1038/nm1616"}

Recently, pathogenic mutations were identified in serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5), the gene that encodes lympho-epithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI), a type of serine protease inhibitor involved in the regulation of skin barrier formation and immunity. In the present report, we describe the mutation analysis of two Taiwanese patients with NS. Patient 1 has heterozygous mutations; the maternal allele has novel T808I (C-T transition in codon 808) and the paternal allele has recurrent R790X (C-T transition in codon 790). Patient 2 is homozygous for a novel polymorphism R267Q (G-A transition in codon 267). The change was not detected in the patient's father. Haplotype analysis revealed that the patient was homozygous for the 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomic sequence of SPINK5 as well as the flanking (GT)(17) and D5S413, in addition to the discrepancy of R267Q. Nevertheless real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed no microdeletion in the genomic sequence of SPINK5. Thus uniparental disomy of maternal SPINK5 allele was indicated.", "keywords": [], "year": 2007, "doi": "10.1007/s00403-007-0751-z"}

The nature of the enzymes that proteolytically cleave hGH and the regulation of this process are not fully understood. Our objective is to examine if members of a newly discovered human tissue kallikrein family (KLKs) are expressed in the pituitary and if these enzymes can cleave hGH in-vitro. Expression of 12 of the KLKs (KLKs 4-15) and serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5) genes and their proteins in the pituitary was examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Recombinant hGH was digested by various recombinant KLKs and fragments were characterized by N-terminal sequencing. SPINK5 recombinant fragments were used for inhibition of KLK activities. We here describe for the first time expression of numerous KLKs (KLKs 5-8, 10-14) and SPINK5 in the pituitary. KLK6 and SPINK5 appeared to be localized to hGH-producing cells. KLKs 4-6, 8, 13 and 14 were able to cleave hGH, yielding various isoforms, in vitro. Inhibitor SPINK5 fragments were able to suppress activity of KLKs 4, 5 and 14 in vitro. Based on these data, we propose a model for the proteolytic processing of hGH in the pituitary and the regulation of this system by SPINK5 inhibitory domains. We speculate that loss of SPINK5 inhibitory domains, as in the case of Netherton syndrome, may lead to proteolytic over-processing of hGH and to growth retardation. We conclude that many KLKs and SPINK5 are expressed in the pituitary. This serine protease-inhibitor system is likely to participate in the regulated proteolytic processing of hGH in the pituitary, leading to generation of hGH fragments. Our data suggest that KLKs 5, 6 and 14 might be involved in this process.", "keywords": [], "year": 2007, "doi": "10.1016/j.cca.2006.10.009"}
